Hello! My name is Ria and this is my coding portfolio! I decided to put some of my favorite projects I've worked on over the years here for everyone to see. Just an FYI, I've never used GitHub/worked with it, so I'm still figuring things out.

My first project is a 3D rocket simulation that simulates the trajectory of a rocket launch. I first define basic constants and parameters for the rocket and Earth, then I implement functions to calculate air density, gravity, and rocket mass over time. The heart of my simulation is the "rocket_dynamics" function, which computes the forces acting on the rocket (like thrust, drag, gravity, and the Coriolis effect) and determines its acceleration. Using these dynamics, my code solves the equations of motion with "solve_ivp", then processes and visualizes the results with four plots showing the 3D trajectory, altitude, velocity, and acceleration over time. Finally, my code prints the maximum altitude reached and the ground distance traveled by the rocket. This is probably my most complex and difficult project yet, but I had so much fun learning more about rockets and learning/applying tricky calculus topics I knew nothing about into my code. 

The second project I'll be showing you is a simulation of the membrane potential dynamics of a group of five neurons over a specified time period. I initialize parameters like membrane time constant, resistance, and threshold potential, and generate random input currents for each neuron during a defined time window. The simulation loop updates each neuron's membrane potential based on the input current and checks if the potential reaches a threshold, indicating a spike. If a spike occurs, the membrane potential is reset, and the spike is recorded. I visualize both the membrane potentials and spike trains of the neurons using Matplotlib plots. This was a fun project because I learned  more about the brain, which fascinates me.

The third project I'll be showing you is a code that processes a text (Pride and Prejudice) to compute character and word entropy, as well as conditional entropy based on specified context lengths. I also include methods for visualizing word frequency distributions according to Zipf's law and generating new text using a Markov chain model based on the processed text's character statistics. 

The final project I'll be showing you is a mini F1 race simulation, focusing on tyre management and strategy while accounting for changing weather conditions, driver performance, and random incidents. It models tyre degradation based on compound type, age, and weather, while incorporating driver attributes that influence lap times and incident probability. The simulation implements a dynamic pit stop strategy responding to tyre wear and weather changes, running for a set number of laps (default 50). It generates visualizations of tyre strategy, weather conditions, and lap times throughout the race. Then, the code provides summary statistics including average lap time, fastest and slowest laps, and the number of pit stops.
